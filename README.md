This is a mod I made for Rimworld that allows Kiiros to wear vacsuits. 

To use this mod, if you have Rimworld on Steam, go to the Steam workshop page for it (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3536347459) and click Subscribe, then activate it in a mod manager or in-game. Alternatively, you can download this mod from here, place the Kiiro Vacsuit Patch folder into the Mods folder of Rimworld wherever you have it installed, and then activate it in a mod manager or in-game.
